# koa-mongo-api-starter

A boilerplate to get started building a REST API with Koa, MongoDB and Docker

## This boilerplate includes

- [Koa](http://koajs.com/)
- [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)
- Isolated integration tests with [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) and [mongomen](https://github.com/CImrie/mongomem)
- Password encryption with [bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [standard config](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard)
- [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) to restart the server whenever you make changes
- Input validation with [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
- Email and password authentication and [JWT](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)

## To run this make sure you have

- GIT
- Nodejs 8+
- Yarn or NPM
- Docker and docker-compose

> Docker is not mandatory, but if you don't have it you need to install and configure MongoDB.

## Clone the repo and install the deps

```sh
# clone into project-name and remove the .git dir
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/oPauloChaves/koa-mongo-api-starter.git project-name && cd project-name && rm -rf .git

# Get dependencies with Yarn
$ yarn install

# or NPM
$ npm install
```

## Commands

Command             | Action                   |
--------------------|--------------------------|
`yarn run dev`      | Run in development mode  |
`yarn start`        | Run in production mode   |
`yarn test`         | Run the tests once       |
`yarn test:watch`   | Run and watch the tests  |
`yarn run lint`     | Lint the code            |

## Docker support

You don't have install and configure MongoDB and run each service (API and Mongo) in a separate window. Docker handles al that for you. You just need to run:

```sh
$ docker-compose build --force-rm   # Build the services and remove intermediate containers
$ docker-compose up                 # Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service.
```

> NOTE: If you change a service's `Dockerfile` or the contents of its build directory, you can run `docker-compose build` to rebuild it.
